This is my reinforcement learning toolkit. rebar! It helps with reinforcement!

It's descended from the toolkit of the same name packaged with
[megastep](http://andyljones.com/megastep/reference.html#module-rebar). As with that one, and as with my [general
toolkit](https://github.com/andyljones/aljpy), this is not a stable library and it's not intended to be used by
anyone but myself. That said, it is fairly modular and there are various chunks of code that are approaching
stability and could be helpful to copy-paste.
